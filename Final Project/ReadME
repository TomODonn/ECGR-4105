To use the FinalProject, both the FinalProject.ipynb and data.csv file need to be downloaded.
The second cell in the FinalProject.ipynb file might need adjustment dependent upon the location of the data.csv file.
This notebook was created using Colab and therefore uses a string that leads to the Google drive folder that houses the data file.
Make sure to adjust this string on the pd.read_csv() call in cell 2.

For the predictor, Budget and Runtime are both just numerical entries.
For the Genre, Season, Lead Actor, and Director dropdowns are provided to choose from the categorical features in the dataset.
